Title: A Day at the Market

The local market was always alive with sound and color. Vendors shouted their prices, children ran between stalls, and the smell of roasted peanuts mixed with fresh mangoes filled the air. I used to follow my grandmother as she bargained for vegetables. She never paid the first price offered—she would smile, shake her head, and keep moving until she found the best deal. Watching her was like watching an artist at work.

What I liked most was the energy. Every stand told a story: the fisherman who had been up since dawn, the woman selling herbs from her own garden, the boy carrying baskets twice his size. It wasn’t perfect—sometimes people argued, sometimes it was too crowded—but it felt real. You could see life unfolding in front of you.

Today, supermarkets are cleaner and quieter, but I miss the chaos. The market taught me patience, taught me to listen, and gave me the feeling of being part of something bigger than myself. Even if I only bought a few bananas, I always left with more than food. I left with memories and lessons that stay with me even now.
