Title: Memories from My Neighborhood

I still remember the empty lot behind our house. It wasn’t much to look at—just dirt, patches of grass, and a few broken bottles scattered around. But to us kids, it was a stadium, a battlefield, and a playground all in one. We would kick a worn-out ball around until the sun disappeared behind the roofs, and even then we often stayed longer than we should. The neighbors sometimes yelled at us for being too loud, but we hardly cared. Those were the moments when laughter felt endless.

I can’t really explain why that place mattered so much. Maybe it was because we didn’t have phones or fancy gadgets, and our imagination was enough. Sometimes the ball went missing, and we’d spend hours searching, turning the hunt into a game itself. The dust, the heat, the noise—all of it is still vivid in my mind. 

Now, when I pass by, I only see a parking lot where our field used to be. Cars stand where we once fell chasing the ball. Every time I walk by, I feel like part of my childhood has been erased, replaced by something practical but lifeless. And no one who parks there would ever know the joy that lived on that patch of land.
