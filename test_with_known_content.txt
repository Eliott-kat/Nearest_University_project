Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns. In particular, climate change since the mid-20th century refers to the unprecedented rate of change attributed to human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases greenhouse gas concentrations in Earth's atmosphere. The scientific consensus is that human activities are the primary driver of climate change since the mid-20th century. Natural climate variations still occur, but they are dwarfed by human impact. The effects of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and shifts in precipitation patterns.
