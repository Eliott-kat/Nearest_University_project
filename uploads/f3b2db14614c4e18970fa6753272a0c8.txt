Wikipedia is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing system called MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history. It is consistently one of the 15 most popular websites ranked by Alexa; as of 2024, Wikipedia was ranked the 5th most popular site in the world. It is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.

Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined the name Wikipedia as a portmanteau of the words wiki and encyclopedia. Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.8 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 62 million articles, attracting 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 17 million edits per month. In 2005, Nature published a study comparing Wikipedia's accuracy to that of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica for 42 articles covering scientific topics, and found that the two were close in terms of the number of factual errors.
