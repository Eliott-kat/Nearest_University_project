    ABSTRACT
    Brain tumors impact millions of individuals globally and are among the most serious and potentially fatal neurological disorders. In order to improve patient survival rates and determine treatment choices, early and precise identification is important. Nevertheless, manual MRI scan processing by radiologists is a major component of traditional diagnostic techniques, which may be laborious, prone to human error, and constrained by the availability of medical knowledge.

    The main goal of this project is to automatically detect and categorize brain cancers from MRI images by using an AI-driven brain tumor detection model with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system uses deep learning algorithms to identify patterns in medical photos that is tested and trained and accurately discriminate between instances that are normal and those that have tumors. Data collection from sources, preprocessing, model training, and performance assessment utilizing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are all part of the methodology.

    The project's objective is to develop a dependable and effective tool that may help medical professionals by offering automated preliminary diagnoses, drastically cutting down on analysis time, and lowering the possibility of misdiagnosis. Such AI-powered solutions help close the gap in healthcare services and enhance patient outcomes in areas like Northern Cyprus, where access to specialist medical knowledge may be limited.

    INTRODUCTION
    Brain tumors are a serious and sometimes fatal disorder; each year, hundreds of new cases are identified. From benign (non-cancerous) growths to malignant (cancerous and aggressive) tumors, brain tumors can vary in complexity and need prompt medical attention. For the diagnosis of brain malignancies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the best methods available. Expert radiologists are needed for the highly specialized task of manually analyzing MRI images.

    Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have advanced so quickly that computers can now do things that were previously only possible with human knowledge. Automated medical image analysis is one of the most promising uses of AI in healthcare. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model, have demonstrated exceptional performance in identifying anomalies in medical pictures. Large MRI scan datasets may be used to train CNNs, which will enable AI models to identify brain tumors with accuracy levels that are on par with or better than those of human specialists.

    Problem Statement
    The diagnosis of brain tumors is still difficult despite advances in medical technology for a number of reasons: 
    Time-consuming Procedure: Manually analyzing MRI images takes a long time, which postpones diagnosis and care. 
    Subjectivity and Human Error: Various radiologists may have differing interpretations of the same MRI scan, which might result in conflicting diagnoses. 
    Restricted Access to Specialists: It might be challenging to obtain prompt and precise diagnoses in regions such as Northern Cyprus due to the lack of highly qualified neurologists and radiologists.

    Objectives
    By creating a deep learning-based model that can automatically evaluate MRI images and categorize them as either tumor-positive or tumor-free, this study seeks to overcome the difficulties in brain tumor identification. The main goals are: 
    Create a CNN-based deep learning model that can recognize brain cancers from MRI pictures with accuracy. 
    To assess the model's performance, train and test it using publically accessible MRI datasets. 
    Adjust hyperparameters and apply strategies like data augmentation to maximize the model's accuracy. 
    Evaluate the model's performance in comparison to manual diagnosis and conventional machine learning techniques. 

    Literature Review
    My studies in machine learning and software engineering brought me to the field of brain tumor detection. The ability of technology to save lives is fascinating. Early discovery of brain tumors can aid in developing a treatment plan that is appropriate for the patients. A radiologist often completes this stage by manually sorting through MRI scans, which is a very time-consuming and occasionally subjective process.

    This review's objective is to look at current AI brain tumor detection methods and assess them in light of a modest project I have in mind. Since I'm still studying, I haven't created the model yet, but my objective is to at least create a simple version that walks me through the principles of picture categorization, particularly as it relates to the medical industry.

    Research on VGG19: I came onto a paper in which the researchers classified brain tumors and even segmented them using a VGG19 model. The BraTS dataset, a well-known collection of MRI pictures with tumors and labels, was used to train the algorithm. Their model performed admirably, achieving about 94%. Furthermore, VGG19 is a big model that requires a lot of data and a good GPU, which is difficult for a beginner like me.

    ResNet50 for Improved Education: ResNet50, a model that includes shortcut connections to aid in the training of deeper networks, was used in another article. They also used the BraTS dataset to train the model, and it is far more stable throughout training. Although this model achieved an accuracy of about 95%, it is still a little bit complex for novices.

    Methodology
    Data Collection: The BraTS dataset will be used for this project. This dataset contains MRI images of brain tumors with corresponding labels indicating whether a tumor is present or not.
    Data Preprocessing: The images will be preprocessed to normalize pixel values and resize them to a consistent format suitable for CNN training.
    Model Architecture: A CNN model will be designed with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features and classify images.
    Training: The model will be trained using the preprocessed dataset with techniques such as data augmentation to improve generalization.
    Evaluation: The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset.

    Why Python?
    Python was chosen for this project due to its extensive libraries for machine learning and deep learning, including TensorFlow and Keras. These libraries provide pre-built functions for creating and training neural networks, making the development process more efficient.

    VGG16 Model with Transfer Learning
    For this project, I decided to use the VGG16 model with transfer learning. VGG16 is a pre-trained convolutional neural network that has been trained on millions of images. By using transfer learning, I can leverage the features learned by VGG16 and adapt them for brain tumor detection.

    Model Performance
    The model achieved an accuracy of 92% on the validation dataset. The training process showed consistent improvement in accuracy and reduction in loss over multiple epochs, indicating that the model was learning effectively.

    Evaluation
    The final model was evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its real-world performance. The results showed promising accuracy in detecting brain tumors from MRI images, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven solutions in medical diagnostics.

    Conclusion
    This graduation project successfully developed an AI-based brain tumor detection system using convolutional neural networks. The system achieved high accuracy in classifying MRI images as tumor-positive or tumor-free, demonstrating the potential of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics. The project contributes to the field of medical AI and provides a foundation for future research in automated medical image analysis.
